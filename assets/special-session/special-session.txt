                       SPECIAL SESSION
 SYSTEMS-THEORETIC APPROACHES TO LEARNING 4.0: FROM CLASSICAL
               TO QUANTUM NEURAL NETWORKS
The application of dynamical systems theory to enhance learning efficiency has
emerged as a powerful paradigm, offering a principled foundation for understanding,
designing, and optimizing intelligent systems. By providing a structured framework
to analyze information flow, stability, and convergence, dynamical systems theory not
only improves explainability and interpretability but also enables provable guarantees
in both classical and quantum neural networks. This perspective bridges learning,
optimization, and control, transforming training processes into well-posed control
problems that enhance robustness, adaptability, and theoretical rigor. As advances in
areas such as continuous-time modeling, physics-informed learning, and quantum
machine learning continue to expand, dynamical systems theory provides the
common language needed to unify these developments and guide the next generation
of learning architectures.
The special session will focus on the role of systems theory in advancing learning
algorithms, particularly within dynamic and evolving environments. It will showcase
cutting-edge developments at the intersection of systems-theoretic principles and
learning methodologies, emphasizing both foundational frameworks and real-world
applications. Key topics include real-time and lifelong learning, continual and
curriculum learning, federated and distributed learning architectures, adaptive
control in deep neural networks, reinforcement learning in single- and multi-agent
systems, adaptive dynamic programming for optimal control in evolving systems,
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), neural ordinary differential equations
(Neural ODEs), quantum computing and quantum machine learning algorithms and
their applications, and system identification techniques such as SINDy, Koopman
operator theory, and other spectral/pseudo-spectral methods. Expert researchers in
these areas will present their findings, demonstrating how integrating systems theory
enhances performance, robustness, and interpretability in modern learning-based
approaches. Attendees will gain insights into the synergy between dynamical systems
theory and both classical and quantum machine learning, uncovering how these
domains complement and reinforce one another. This special session promises a
comprehensive exploration of innovative approaches and their transformative
potential for next generation learning paradigms.
